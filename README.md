Dharma is the premier community-focused software for independent EvE Online
corporations, integrating with ESI.

**Dharma is pre-alpha software still under development, not yet ready for use.**

Corporations using Dharma gain access to private forums catered to EvE features,
integration with corporation calendars and mail, asset and logistics management
aids, industry planning, and market monitoring capabilities.

Dharma is built using the ActivityPub federation protocol. This means that each
corporation has the option to enter data-sharing agreements around any of the
above activities with another corporation also running Dharma. Corporations are
more freely able to associate and disassociate with each other in this way --
including, but not limited to, Alliances and coalitions -- while still
preserving their own unique sense of community, and while still able to
coordinate with each other with an effectiveness that is indistinguishable from
Alliances that are heavily centralized.

That means one-capsuleer or few-capsuleer corporations have new channels through
which they can discover other micro-corporations, and lower the barrier towards
building political networks of mutual aid.

This software only lowers the barrier. The capsuleer makes the corporation.
